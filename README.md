# Rock Paper Scissors Project
## First major project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) curriculum. 
    This is a variation of the classic game, with the same basic premise. The theme is that of the three elements; fire, water and grass. You play against a computer with both of you having 6 lives. A tie does not deduct lives. 

## The game:
 - displays both your and the computer's choices 
 - tracks the lives of each player  
 - displays a custom message for every combination of two elements 
 - displays a different animated end game message depending on the victory status.

--------------------

#### Goals with this project:
- [x] combine html, css and javascript into a unified endproduct. 
- [x]  utilize event listeners to create a buttons and perform actions on the webpage
- [x] gain a deeper understanding of flex box
- [x] learn to better utilize git and commit early and often.

#### What I learned from this experience: 
- a basic understanding of css styling with colors and borders, text-stroke, styling individual words etc.
- a deeper understanding of how to manipulate elements via flexbox
- how to ensure an element displayed as a flexbox is stationary relative to its parent while removing its children elements.
- how to add, remove and change elements and/or classes via javascript. 
- how to interact with the nodes/nodelists and use eventListeners in javascript  
- a basic understanding of animations and how they interact with flexbox
- how to organize my code to be more readable by breaking down complex functions into smaller subfunctions. 

Needs more work: 
- my frequency of commits and commit messages
- creating a more responsive version of the webpage that works on all screens
